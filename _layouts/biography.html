     <p>
       Mo Tiwari is a third-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Stanford University, advised by
       <a href="http://robots.stanford.edu/index.html">Sebastian Thrun</a> (funding advisor)
       and <a href="https://stanford.edu/~cpiech/bio/index.html">Chris Piech</a>. His research interests include
       artificial intelligence, machine learning, and statistics. Prior to joining the Ph.D.
       program at Stanford, Mo worked for several years in industry; most recently, Mo
       was a software engineer and technical lead at Facebook for a cybersecurity product,
       <a href='http://fb.me/TX'> ThreatExchange</a>. Before Facebook, Mo joined Expanse as the fifth full-time employee,
       well before it became the hundred-million-dollar company it is today, and spent a summer at DRW,
       where he developed valuation models for fixed income instruments. During his undergraduate
       studies in Mathematics and Physics at the California Institute of Technology, Mo also worked at the
       Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment at CERN, where the Higgs Boson was later discovered, and
       did theoretical research in quantum computation.

       Mo holds degrees from the California Institute of Technology (BS '13, Mathematics, Physics)
       and Stanford University (MS '19, Computer Science). At Stanford University, Mo is supported by a
