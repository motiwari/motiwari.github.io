  Thank you for visiting my website! I'm currently a Ph.D. student in Computer
  Science at Stanford University, advised by
  <a href="http://robots.stanford.edu/personal.html">Sebastian Thrun</a> and
  <a href="https://stanford.edu/~cpiech/bio/index.html">Chris Piech</a>.
author_bio2: >-
  I have an unconventional path to the Ph.D.
  program in that I worked for 4 years in between my undergraduate and graduate
  studies. I have an eclectic career spanning particle physics,
  quantum computation, finance, cybersecurity, virtual and augmented reality,
  artificial intelligence, machine learning, and healthcare -- largely because
  I love learning new things about math, physics, statistics, and computer
  science!
