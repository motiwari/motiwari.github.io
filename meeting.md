    <p>
    Hi! Thanks for reaching out! If I've sent you to this page, it's so that we can schedule a time together!

My preferences are for meetings that are consolidated with my other meetings (i.e. immediately before or after)

I also have a preference for meeting near my office building (Gates) if we're meeting during business hours.

To schedule a meeting with me, please send me an invite via doodle.com/motiwari (preferred). Note that some people have trouble using Doodle on mobile, so if you're using a mobile device try calendly.com/motiwari. Please include the location to meet and/or your phone number/Skype/Google Hangout/email.
